# Digital Systems Design and Implementation

This is the culmination of a semester worth of ECE 385, Digital Systems Laboratory, at the University of Illinois done by Gustavo Fonseca and Hunter Baisden.

In this class we worked on each lab together and explored a variety of FPGA concepts. 

Each lab, all of its components, and the correspinding report can be found inside of this repository. 

## Labs 

**Lab 1:** a solo lab where the work was already done. The corresponding report is only Gustavo's Report

**Lab 2:** fully hardware 4 bit processor with 8 arithmetic functions, built entirely on a breadboard

**Lab 3:** introduction to system verilog saw the creation of 3 different adders

**Lab 4:** building on the adders this is an 8-bit shift multiplier

**Lab 5:** this is almost the fully implementation of lc3 inside of system veriilog, with a few things missing. Called slc3

**Lab 6:** introduced the vga capabilites as well as usb protocol

**Lab 7:** pallatte colors and screen savers

**Final Project:** *The Binding of an ECE Major* an implemtation of the binding of isaac with an ECE twist. It can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/i_g9_j7QDNE)

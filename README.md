## Projects
### 1. Fusion of Visual and Near-Infrared Images
**Motivation**: There has been significant interest in the fusion of VIS and NIR images for many applications, such as remote sensing, medical imaging, and surveillance. The NIR image contains details that are often absent in the VIS image, particularly from shadows, strong saturation, or low contrast.

**Description**: For my Senior Thesis project I am researching different methods of enhancing visual images with information present in near-infrared images using a variety of digitial signal and image processing techniques. 

**Skills Used**: Wavelet Transform, Bilateral Filtering, Image Quality metrics, Texture and Contrast Tranferring, Histogram Matching, Alpha Blending.

### 2. Portrait Mode
**Motivation**: Have you ever taken a picture using Portrait Mode on an iPhone? Is it not cool that they are able to highlight the subject and foreground while blurring the background in real-time?

**Description**: Implemented the portrait mode in an Android application, featuring foreground-background segmentation and dynamic video feed manipulation. 

**Skills Used**: Java, Android SDK, Camera API, Real-Time Image Processing, Computer Vision, Embedded Systems.

### 3. Reproducing "Understanding Deep Learning Requires Rethinking Generalization" by Zhang et al., 2017.
**Motivation**: To get more experience with machine learning, my group and I decided to reproduce an influencial paper in the field.

**Description**: We reproduced the key experiments decribed in Zhang's paper, discussing deep learning generalization and the effects of regularization and data corruption on model performance.  

**Skills Used**: Python, PyTorch, Machine Learning, Data Augmentation, Neural Networks, Reproducibility in Research.

### 4. Implementation of the game "Binding of Issac" on an FPGA
**Motivation**: "Binding of Issac" is an action-adventure 2D game which my partner and I both enjoyed and wanted to recreate with a twist.

**Description**: Our game, "Binding of an ECE Major", is a game designed purely with digital logic in an FPGA; i.e., no software was compiled or interpreted. The game only uses sequential and combinatorial digital circuits. 

**Skills Used**: SystemVerilog, System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions, Assembly, FPGAs, Digital Simulators, State Machines, Timing Analysis, Microprocessor Integration.

### 5. Comparing JPEG vs JPEG2000
**Motivation**: JPEG2000 is an evolution of JPEG's image compression standard. However, it is not widely adopted. What are we missing my not adpoting JPEG2000?

**Description**: An in-depth analysis of image compression techniques comparing Progressive and Hierarchical JPEG formats with JPEG2000, focusing on compression efficiency, load times, and their impact on web performance.  

**Skills Used**: Image Compression, Web Performance Testing, Digital Archiving, Mobile Optimization.

### 6. Spy Camera Localization
**Motivation**: How can we locate a hidden spy camera? What if we could sniff the packets or messages transmitted by the camera with a portable device that locates the camera?

**Description**: In this project, we utilized an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), WiFi receiver, and a Raspberry Pi and developed code to process the IMU and RSSI data to estimate the location of hidden WiFi cameras or transmitters. Our code combined trajectory plotting, signal strength analysis, and real-time feedback for precise positioning.  

**Skills Used**: Python, Sensor Fusion, Sensor Data Processing, Trajectory Analysis, RSSI Integration, Real-Time Localization.

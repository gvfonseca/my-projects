# Visual and Near-Infrared Image Fusion

## Description
This ongoing project is for my Senior Thesis at the University of Illinois. This project has many parts to it, including literature review and progress reports focusing on specific aspects of the project. For instance, in [Wavelet Evaluation Report](./Wavelet_Evaluation.pdf), I explored using different levels of the wavelet decomposition for better image enhancement results.

My research is focused on image enhancement with visual (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) images in an embedded setting.
